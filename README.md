## Frank Grimes: Twitter Bot

A Twitter Bot representing the persona 'Frank Grimes' from the well known TV Show "The Simpsons". 
While the content produced from the bot no longer necessarily represents Frank Grimes, it's still fun to see him pump out endless streams of garbage into the twittersphere

## Motivation

This repository represents a small project I developed with the help of the internet and peers to learn how to read and use API, code in python and roughly follow extended development of software through version tracking and other methods.

## Getting Started

If you would like to run this twitter bot as your own I welcome you to do so, the code isn't exactly glorifying but I hope it can be of use to you all in trying to use the Twitter API.
Note the twitter bot has not been maintained for some time so issues may exist.

### Installation

* Acquire Twitter API Consumer Key/Secret and Access Key/Secret
* Make a Heroku Account and verify
* Set these in your environment variables on the machine you are running the code on
* Install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file
* Run twitterbot.py and the bot will walk through one "session"
* Designed to be run on Heroku with the Heroku Scheduler add-on (I personally used a daily schedule, but code can be changed to work for any time interval).
